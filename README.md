# Vision-Guided-Mobile-Robot-for-Automated-Object-Retrieval
I developed a mobile robotic system capable of autonomously navigating an arena and relocating scattered objects to their designated places. While the arena in this project is a restricted and obstacle-free zone, and the objects are classified based on color, further advancements can be done for bots effective in domains as warehouse inventory management, housekeeping etc..
